                    This website was created with the purpose of indexing all the assignments completed by Kevin Huang in the class 91.61 GUI Programming I and will be continuously updated
                    throughout the semester. Therefore the site is still under construction and some links may be dead or still under construction. Feel free to explore the nav bar to
                    see what has been completed.

                        This assignment was the creation of the first website which would also function as the index for future assignments that
                        would be assigned in GUI Programming I as well as showing some basic info on Kevin Huang

                    <li class="AsDescrip">
                        This assignment was an excercise in learning how to use external CSS style sheets to replicate an example website of a resort
                        called Pacific Trails Resort. It tested knowledge of web page styling as well as whether or not you could see some of the sneaky
                        stylings that were going on in the background.
                    </li>
                    <li class="headers">Assignment 3 - Styling Your First Web Page with CSS</li>
                    <li class="AsDescrip">
                        This assignment was a combination of the previous two assignments. We took the original ugly appearance of a purely html web
                        page that I first made and used the external CSS techniques on it that were learned and reinforced when recreating the Pacific Trails
                        Resort website.
